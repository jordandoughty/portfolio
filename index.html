        <h2>Hello,</h2>
    <p>I currently live in Boise, Idaho as an audio engineer for a local venue called <a href="https://www.loungeboise.com/">The Lounge at the End of the Universe.</a></p>
    <p>In my spare time I like to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work on a game I develop for on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/869480/Jabroni_Brawl_Episode_3/">Steam</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/bageltiger">Make music</a></li>

        <h3>About Jordan</h3>
        <p> As a recent graduate with a degree in audio/music engineering, I searched every field and position I could to solidify my career in the music industry. During that time, I've come across droves of wonderful people and experiences that I wouldn't trade for the world. Today I study in code to become a more effective quality assurance analyst, and to one day develop my own audio programs and synthesizers from the ground up.</p>

        <p>With the current work I've procured at the Lounge at the End of the Universe, I've become adept at solving problems quickly and efficiently while thinking out of the box. Most of my role at the Lounge also requires effective teamwork and communication, which is an element in the workplace that I thrive with. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you think a charismatic music loving developer would be a great fit to your team and project.</p>
